# How to download textbook to JupyterHub

When in your JupyterHub `Launcher`, click on `Terminal` and paste this command:

```{bash}
svn export https://github.com/lundquist-ecology-lab/biostatistcs_with_python/trunk/textbook
```

This will download the textbook off of GitHub and create a folder called "textbook" that will have all of the .ipynb and image files associated with the textbook and images.
