    "### Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of an event based on new evidence. It is stated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) × P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a medical test for a rare disease, where only 1% of the population is affected. Let event A be having the disease, and event B be testing positive for the disease. Suppose the test is 95% accurate, meaning P(B|A) = 0.95, and the probability of having the disease P(A) = 0.01. If a randomly selected individual tests positive, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(B) = P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|not A) × P(not A)= (0.95 × 0.01) + (0.05 × 0.99) ≈ 0.0595$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A|B) = \\frac{(P(B|A) × P(A))}{P(B)} = \\frac{(0.95 × 0.01)}{0.0595} ≈ 0.159$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The implication of the result obtained using Bayes' Theorem in the given example is that even if an individual tests positive for a rare disease with a test that has a high accuracy rate (95% in this case), the probability of actually having the disease is relatively low (approximately 15.9% or 0.159).\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that a positive test result should not be interpreted as a definitive confirmation of the disease. Instead, further investigation, such as additional tests or medical evaluation, should be considered to confirm the diagnosis. In the context of rare diseases, false positives can be more common due to the low prevalence of the condition in the population. This phenomenon, known as the \"base rate fallacy,\" emphasizes the importance of considering the prior probability (prevalence) of the disease when interpreting test results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implication of this result is that caution should be exercised in making decisions based solely on the outcome of a single test. Proper consideration of the accuracy of the test, as well as the prevalence of the disease in the population, is crucial to avoid misdiagnosis or unnecessary treatments. It highlights the need for a comprehensive approach that combines multiple pieces of information, including clinical evaluation and other diagnostic tools, to make informed decisions regarding an individual's health."
