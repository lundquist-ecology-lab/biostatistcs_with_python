    "### Types of Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the types of data, or variables, is the first step in effective data analysis. Variables can broadly be classified as numerical and categorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Numerical variables** represent measurements or counts and can be subdivided into two types:\n",
    "    - **Discrete:** These variables take on only certain values within a given range, such as the number of petals on a flower or the number of cells in a tissue sample.\n",
    "    - **Continuous:** These variables can take on any value within a range, like the weight of an organism or the pH level of a solution.\n",

    "2. **Categorical variables** represent qualitative data and identify a particular group or category to which data points belong. Examples include the species of a plant, the type of a disease, or the color of a bird's feathers. We define each value factor (e.g., blue, green, red) as **level** or a **group**.\n",

    "### Data Collection Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Collecting accurate and relevant data is critical for scientific investigations. The two primary study designs for data collection are experimental and observational studies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Experimental studies** involve designing an experiment with specific treatments and controls for outside variables. This design is useful for determining cause and effect relationships but may be challenging to generalize to broader, real-world contexts.\n",
    "<div style=\"display:flex; justify-content:center;\">\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Observational studies** involve making observations in the real world without intervening. These studies are good for identifying patterns but don't control for outside variables, making it difficult to infer causality.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"display:flex; justify-content:center;\">\n",

    "\n",
    "Data can be collected from a complete group, known as the population, or a subset of that group, called a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Population (N):** This is the complete set of data from a particular source. Any conclusions drawn directly from a population are called parameters. These are constant and exact.\n",
    "2. **Sample (n):** This is a subset of data drawn from the population for analysis. Conclusions from sample data, termed estimates, are random and approximate.\n",

    "### Sampling Errors and Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with samples, two key considerations are sampling error and bias:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sampling error** refers to the random discrepancies between the sample estimate and the true population parameter. The larger the sample size, the smaller the sampling error, as the sample becomes more representative of the population.\n",
    "2. **Sampling bias** occurs when certain members of the population are more likely to be sampled than others. This bias can be mitigated by ensuring samples are selected randomly. However, achieving true randomness can be challenging in certain scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several common sources of sampling bias include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample of convenience:** Researchers select the easiest samples to collect.\n",
    "- **Volunteer bias:** Data comes only from members of the population who voluntarily provide data, such as respondents to a survey.\n"
